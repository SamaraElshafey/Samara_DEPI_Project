# Healthcare Predictive Analytics

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Healthcare Predictive Analytics** project is centered around building a predictive model to enhance healthcare outcomes through data-driven insights. By leveraging machine learning, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in:

- Predicting patient risks  
- Identifying trends in health metrics  
- Making more informed clinical decisions  

The ultimate goal is to improve patient care quality and optimize healthcare resource management through actionable predictions and recommendations.

## 🗂️ Project Milestones

The project will progress through the following phases:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather relevant healthcare datasets from public sources or partnerships with institutions.
   
2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, anomalies, and insights.
   
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean, normalize, and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
   
4. **Advanced Analysis**  
   - Apply statistical and analytical techniques to uncover deeper insights and relationships in the data.
   
5. **Model Development**  
   - Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict healthcare outcomes.
   
6. **Deployment**  
   - Integrate the model into a usable application or interface for healthcare professionals.
   
7. **Final Documentation**  
   - Provide comprehensive documentation covering the methodology, usage, and insights generated from the project.
